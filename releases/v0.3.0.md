Release title
v0.3.0 - Upgraded Python Simulator v3 (Full API Parity + Visual Overhaul)

## Summary
Major upgrade to the Robotarium-compatible Python simulator with full API parity against the official `robotarium_python_simulator`, a visually overhauled GitHub Pages web interface (v3), and expanded safety/control primitives. The simulator now covers all features available in real Robotarium experiments and serves as a comprehensive pre-flight verification tool.

## Features
- Full Robotarium API parity: CLF-based unicycle position and pose controllers, unicycle barrier certificates (with and without boundary), SI-to-unicycle obstacle-aware dynamics, unicycle-to-SI reverse transform, graph Laplacian utilities, convergence checkers.
- GRITSBot hardware velocity limits enforced in simulator (0.2 m/s linear, pi rad/s angular).
- GitHub Pages v3 web simulator with: GRITSBot-shaped robots showing heading, numbered labels, fading trail history, arena grid with coordinate labels, phase timeline bar, real-time info panel, playback speed controls (0.5x-4x), pause/resume/restart, drag-and-drop file upload.
- iOS-friendly: upload .py file (or use default) and press Play — no terminal required.
- All Python files pass ruff lint and format checks across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

## Notes
Use the simulator as a pre-submission verification step before running physical Robotarium experiments. The v3 web interface provides a more accurate visual representation of robot behaviour including heading direction, motion trails, and phase-aware timeline display. All new API functions match the official Robotarium Python simulator signatures for seamless code portability.
