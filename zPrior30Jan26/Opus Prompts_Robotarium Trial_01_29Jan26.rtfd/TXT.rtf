Create all the files necessary to run a 60 second GA Tech Robotarium physical robot experiment (https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/experiment) using 2 robots with Python. One robot should be the clinical trial nurse, and the other robot should be the patient. \'93For instance, careful navigation may represent walking in a relatively straight line with avoidance of some obstacles; patient approach may be walking in a relatively straight line and then pausing; and dynamic environment might be walking with a larger array of movements that change based on conditions.\'93 Keep in mind that your Python based files must meet the Robotarium's requirements to run on their servers.\

Investigated Robotarium API requirements for dual-robot simulation experiment.\
\
\
\
I'll help you create Python files for a Robotarium experiment. Let me first search for the Robotarium's Python API requirements to ensure the code meets their specifications.\

Architected Robotarium simulation framework with nurse-patient robot dynamics.\
\

\

Now I have enough information about the Robotarium API. Let me create the Python files for your clinical trial robot experiment.\
\
\
8 steps\
\
Presented 2 files\
\
Orchestrated robotics experiment files meeting Robotarium specifications.\
\
I've created the Robotarium experiment files for your clinical trial nurse-patient simulation. Here's what the experiment does:\
\
Robot 0 (Nurse):\
\
Navigates carefully through waypoints in a relatively straight path\
Approaches the patient robot's area\
Pauses for ~3 seconds to simulate patient interaction\
Returns to the starting position\
Operates at 70% speed for deliberate, careful movement\
Robot 1 (Patient):\
\
Exhibits dynamic, environmentally-responsive movements\
Behavior changes based on nurse proximity:\
Normal dynamic patterns when nurse is far\
Moderate awareness activity when nurse approaches\
Subtle, responsive movements when nurse is close\
Includes sinusoidal variations for realistic human-like motion\
To submit your experiment:\
\
Go to https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/experiment\
Enter your experiment details (Title: Trial_01_29Jan26, Duration: 60 sec, Robots: 2)\
Upload the main.py file\
Submit the experiment\
The code uses Robotarium's safety features including barrier certificates for collision avoidance between robots and boundary walls.\

To increase the number of robots in the script, do I just change the N = ?\
\
12:26 PM\
\
Examined why changing N alone proves insufficient for scaling robots.\
\
\
\
\
Not quite \'97 changing N alone won't be enough because the script has several parts that are hardcoded for exactly 2 robots:\
\
What you'd need to update:\
\
N = 2 \uc0\u8594  Change to your desired number\
initial_conditions \uc0\u8594  Add columns for each new robot:\
python\
   initial_conditions = np.array([\
       [-0.4, 0.4, 0.0],   # x positions (3 robots now)\
       [0.0, 0.0, 0.2],    # y positions\
       [0.0, np.pi, 0.0]   # theta orientations\
   ])\
Robot indices \uc0\u8594  Add new constants:\
python\
   NURSE = 0\
   PATIENT = 1\
   ASSISTANT = 2  # new robot\
Waypoints \uc0\u8594  Define paths for new robots\
Main control loop \uc0\u8594  Add control logic for each new robot's behavior\
Quick example for 3 robots:\
\
python\
# In the main loop, after patient control:\
# ========================================\
# ASSISTANT CONTROL (Robot 2)\
# ========================================\
assistant_target = np.array([0.0, -0.2])  # example target\
assistant_velocity = si_position_controller(\
    x_si[:, ASSISTANT:ASSISTANT+1],\
    assistant_target.reshape(2, 1)\
)\
si_velocities[:, ASSISTANT:ASSISTANT+1] = assistant_velocity * 0.8\
Would you like me to create an updated version of the script with more robots? Just let me know how many and what roles/behaviors you'd like them to have.\
