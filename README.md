Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and documentation for experiments run on the [Georgia Tech Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) - a remotely accessible, $2.5 million swarm robotics research platform funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Office of Naval Research.


## v0.3.0 Upgraded Simulator (Full API Parity + Visual Overhaul)

This repository includes a built-in Robotarium-compatible simulator with full API parity against the official `robotarium_python_simulator`:
- **In browser (GitHub Pages v3, iOS-friendly):** upload/drag a `.py` file and press **Play** — heading arrows, motion trails, phase timeline, speed controls
- **Locally in Python:** run experiment files directly with only NumPy (pre-flight verification before Robotarium submission)

### Quick Start (no terminal on iOS)
1. Open GitHub Pages for this repo (serving `docs/index.html`).
2. Keep default script or upload/drag a `.py` Robotarium script, then press **Play**.

### Quick Start (local pre-flight check)
```bash
python Exp_01a_12Feb26.py
```

## Experiments

### Trial_01_29Jan26 - Clinical Trial Nurse-Patient Simulation
- **Duration:** 60 seconds
- **Robots:** 2 GRITSBot units
- **Description:** Original trial simulating clinical trial interactions between nurse and patient robots
- **Status:** ✅ Completed (January 30, 2026)

📹 **Video:** [Watch Experiment on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Q9Va8vZhKIaC9hvBp60CX3MiqVKjEXY?usp=sharing)

Original Opus 4.5 Extended Prompt: “Create all the files necessary to run a 60 second GA Tech Robotarium physical robot experiment (https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/experiment) using 2 robots with Python. One robot should be the clinical trial nurse, and the other robot should be the patient. “For instance, careful navigation may represent walking in a relatively straight line with avoidance of some obstacles; patient approach may be walking in a relatively straight line and then pausing; and dynamic environment might be walking with a larger array of movements that change based on conditions.“ Keep in mind that your Python based files must meet the Robotarium's requirements to run on their servers.”
 
Expected Script Behavior (Opus):
- Robot 0 (Nurse):
a) Navigates carefully through waypoints in a relatively straight path
b) Approaches the patient robot's area
c) Pauses for ~3 seconds to simulate patient interaction
d) Returns to the starting position
e) Operates at 70% speed for deliberate, careful movement
- Robot 1 (Patient): 
a) Exhibits dynamic, environmentally-responsive movements
b) Behavior changes based on nurse proximity:
c) Normal dynamic patterns when nurse is far
d) Moderate awareness activity when nurse approaches
e) Subtle, responsive movements when nurse is close
f) Includes sinusoidal variations for realistic human-like motion

Actual Robot Behavior (Similar to Expected):
- Robot 0 (Nurse, Starts at Top): 
a) Demonstrates careful navigation, approaches the patient (0:50), pauses for interaction (1:06-1:09), then returns away from patient (1:15).
- Robot 1 (Patient, Starts at Bottom): 
a) Exhibits dynamic behavior with varied movements (0:28-1:03), (1:10-1:26) that become less pronounced when closer in proximity to nurse.
