Release title
v0.3.1 - Dual-Experiment Simulator + CI Hardening

## Summary
Added dual-experiment support to the web simulator with a dropdown selector for the 14-robot swarm and 2-robot nurse-patient experiments, dynamic phase timeline and legend adaptation, and CI hardening with explicit dependency management via `requirements.txt` and smoke tests for both experiment scripts across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. README updated with a direct simulation link and three text diagrams covering architecture, arena layout, and experiment timeline perspectives.

## Features
- Web simulator v3.1 experiment selector: choose 14-robot swarm or 2-robot nurse-patient from a dropdown, no file upload needed.
- Dynamic legend and phase timeline: automatically switches between Doctor/Patient and Nurse/Patient labels and phase names based on loaded experiment.
- FRAME_LOG reset between simulation runs for clean replay without page reload.
- `requirements.txt` for explicit NumPy dependency management across CI and local environments.
- CI workflow now tests both `Exp_01a_12Feb26.py` (14-robot) and `main.py` (2-robot) as separate smoke test steps.
- README restructured with web simulator link at top, three text diagrams (Simulator Architecture, Arena Top-Down View, Experiment Timeline Comparison), and explicit experiment sections for both scripts.
- Updated `docs/simulator.md` with v0.3.1 architecture diagram and v0.3.0-to-v0.3.1 comparison table.

## Notes
Use the web simulator dropdown to quickly switch between the 2-robot nurse-patient interaction and the 14-robot swarm triage experiment. The `requirements.txt` file ensures consistent NumPy versions across local development and CI. Both experiment scripts remain fully compatible with the Robotarium physical platform for direct submission.
